# Tutor Homie
An application I use for maintaining my student roster and session schedule.

Basically a simple CRUD app with a few added features. I got tired of entering data into a
spreadsheet to keep track of my students and sessions while tutoring at Trilogy. 

It is currently in super alpha stage. I pretty much just have the environment nearly established.
Still need to add testing and some sort of CI. The first versions are going to be terminal-based.
Then eventually I plan to give it a web-based GUI using React and probably React Native.
